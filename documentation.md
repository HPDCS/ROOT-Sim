# ROOT-Sim documentation

The continuous integration service of ROOT-Sim automatically rebuilds the internal documentation every time
that a development version or a stable version is released.

We release a stable version seldom, after a significant correctness and performance tests have been carried out.
Therefore, we provide here links to both versions of the documentation, as they can be significantly different.

* [Stable version documentation]({{ site.url }}/docs/master/). [![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhpdcs.github.io%2FROOT-Sim%2Fdocs%2Fcoverage%2Fmaster.json)]({{ site.url }}/docs/coverage/master/index.html)
* [Development version documentation]({{ site.url }}/docs/develop/). [![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhpdcs.github.io%2FROOT-Sim%2Fdocs%2Fcoverage%2Fdevelop.json)]({{ site.url }}/docs/coverage/develop/index.html)

We also provide [reports for the documentation coverage]({{ site.url }}/docs/coverage/) as generated in every pull request on GitHub, to enhance the quality of the project documentation.
