/**

 *
 * @brief Assembly build support module
 *
 * This file is not actually compiled into ROOT-Sim. This is used by the
 * system to generate the asm_defines.h file in which several sizes
 * offsets of structs are dynamically generated. In this way, the assembly
 * which we generate does not have to carry hard-coded constants and
 * nasty bugs are less likely to appear.
 *
 * This file is not compiled in the runtime environment, but it is
 * processed in order to generate the @c asm_defines.h one which is
 * included by all assembly files.
