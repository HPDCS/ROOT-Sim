 * @brief Generic thread management facilities.
 *
 * This module provides generic facilities for thread management.
 * In particular, helper functions to startup worker threads are exposed,
 * and a function to synchronize multiple threads on a software barrier.
 *
 * The software barrier also offers a leader election facility, so that
 * once all threads are synchronized on the barrier, the function returns
 * true to only one of them.
