 * @brief User-Level Threads
 *
 * The User-Level Thread module allows the creation/scheduling of multiple
 * co-routines which can yield the CPU to a different one, or that can
 * be preëmpted by some asynchronous event.
 *
 * Due to the possibility of external preëmption, ULTs store the whole
 * CPU context in an ad-hoc buffer. This is a significant difference with
 * respect standard facilities such as setjmp/longjmp which only store
 * callee-save registers.
 *
 * ULTs are used to implement both runtime-level routines (each worker
 * thread has its own execution context) and model-level routines (each
 * LP has its own execution context).
