* @brief x86 ULT support header
*
* This header defines all the facilities to implement User-Level Threads
* on x86.
*
* The core of the implementation is found in jmp.S which is written in
* assembly. jmp.S is undocumented here, but looking at its source will
* give an explanation of all the functions and how they behave.

 * This macro is a wrapper for _set_jmp(), which is the custom implementation
 * of the standard setjmp used in ROOT-Sim.
 * The goal of the wrapper is the following. _set_jmp() requires one
 * parameter, which is the pointer to an exec_context_t where to store the
 * current context. Since the custom implementation is such that *all*
 * registers should be saved in the context, not only callee-save as in the
 * standard implementation, simply calling _set_jmp() clobbers a register
 * which is later not possible to save. This macro pushes the RDI register,
 * used to keep the first parameter of function calls according to SysV ABI,
 * before calling into _set_jmp(). _set_jmp() expects this to happen, as
 * it will find the original value of RDI to save on the stack frame of
 * the caller. This is why it is not possible to directly call _set_jmp()
 * from the code, but this macro must be explicitly used.
 *
 * The semantics of this macro are the same as the called _set_jmp().
 *
 * @param env A pointer to an exec_context_t structure where to store
 *            the current execution contenxt.
 *
 * @return 0 if directly called. Otherwise, upon a context restore via
 *         long_jmp(), the return value is set to the value of the second
 *         argument passed to long_jmp().
