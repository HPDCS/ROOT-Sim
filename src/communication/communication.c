/**
 * @brief convert a message header into a message

 * The purpose of this function is to prepare the sending of an antimessage.
 * Indeed, an antimessage is sent as a message of size zero, and the
 * information is taken from compact versions of the originally sent
 * messages, kept in the @ref msg_hdr_t type. When an antimessage must
 * be sent out, this is done by copying the message header into a
 * @ref msg_t type.
 * This is required because all message sending logic assumes that
 * a @ref msg_t data structure is being passed (this avoid having to
 * perform multiple checks or multiple casts in the code base).
