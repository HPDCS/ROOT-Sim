 * which should not be actually delivered to the simulation model. These
 * are what are referred to as control messages, and are used to implement
 * some sort of distributed (asynchronous) state changes at specific LPs.
 *
 * To properly manage control messages, they must be declared in this
 * enum. Note that the special @ref MIN_VALUE_CONTROL is used to reserve
 * space for application message codes. Anything below that value is
 * considered to be a model-specific message code.
