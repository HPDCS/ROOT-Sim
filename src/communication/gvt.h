/**
 * @brief Define colour values for messages and threads.
 *
 * Messages sent out from a kernel instance are either white or red,
 * depending on the colour of the thread which originated the send operation.
 *
 * Actually, since colour phases are repeating, we differentiate between
 * the first instance of a white phase, the first instance of red phase,
 * the next instance of a white phase, and the next instance of a red
 * phase. The third instance is mapped to the first, as it is ensured
 * that no overlaps in messages might occur.
 *
 * This enum defines the colours for messages, taking into account the
 * multiple phases which occur one after the other. Also threads colours
 * use the same definitions.
 *
 * The order of these values are important. White messages are mapped to
 * even numbers, while red messages are mapped to odd numbers. This is
 * used in macros such as is_red_colour() to quickly determine the colour
 * of a message.
