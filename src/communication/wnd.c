*
* @brief Message delivery support
*
* This module implements the message delivery support functions.
* Message delivery is carried out asynchronously via MPI, therefore
* we need a way to let MPI notify us when a certain message has been
* delivered to the destination simulation kernel and is now in charge of it.
*
* This module implements a set of per-remote-kernel queues in which each
* remote message is registered before an Isend operation is initiated.
*
* MPI will eventually notify us of the delivery of that message. By
* scanning the outgoing queues, we can know what messages have reached
* destination and remove the corresponding entry.
