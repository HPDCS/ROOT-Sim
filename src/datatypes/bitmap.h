* @brief Bitmap data type
*
* This a simple bitmap implemented with some simple macros.
* Keep in mind that some trust is given to the developer since
* the implementation, for performances and simplicity
* reasons, doesn't remember his effective size; consequently
* it doesn't check boundaries on the array that stores the bits.
