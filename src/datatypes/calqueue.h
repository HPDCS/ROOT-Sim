* @brief Calendar Queue Implementation
*
* Classical Calendar Queue implementation. It is an array of lists of
* events which reorganizes itself upon each insertion/deletion, ensuring
* amortized O(1) operations.
*
* Due to the nature of the calendar queue, you cannot insert events which
* "happen before" the last extracted events, otherwise the list breaks
* and starts returning dummy events.
*
* For a thorough description of the algorithm, refer to:
*
* R. Brown
* “Calendar Queues: A Fast 0(1) Priority Queue Implementation for the
* Simulation Event Set Problem”
* CACM, Vol. 31, No. 10, pp. 1220-1227, Oct. 1988.
