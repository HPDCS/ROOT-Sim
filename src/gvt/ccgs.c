* @brief Consistent and Committed Global State
*
* Consistent and Committed Global State (CCGS) is a subsystem that (poeriodically)
* recomputes a global state on which the LPs can inspect the simulation trajectory
* and determine whether the simulation can stop, by relying on the OnGVT() callback.

/**
* This function rebuilds a simulation state aligned to the new GVT for every LP.
* In this way, each LP is asked (via the OnGVT() callback) to check whether the
* simulation can terminate.
* Two different execution modes are available for this function, depending on
* the CCGS level in rootsim_config: committed and consistent.
* The committed version passes to the simulation model for validation the first
* simulation state that is found committed before the GVT commitment horizon.
* Nevertheless, two states passed to two different LPs can be associated with
* different timestamps.
* Running this function in consistent state, realignes the state of all LPs
* to the same simulation time, namely the GVT. This allows all LPs to agree
* on a consistent simulation time for termination detection. This induces, of course,
* an additional overhead, because the runtime environment has to reprocess in
* silent execution multiple events.

* 		as computed by the GVT subsystem
* @param gvt The Global Virtual Time value at which simulation states should be realigned
*               to generate a snapshot inspection which is also consistent
