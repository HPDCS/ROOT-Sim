* @brief Consistent and Committed Global State
*
* Consistent and Committed Global State (CCGS) is a subsystem that (poeriodically)
* recomputes a global state on which the LPs can inspect the simulation trajectory
* and determine whether the simulation can stop, by relying on the OnGVT() callback.
