/**
* This function creates a full log of the current simulation states and returns a pointer to it.
* The algorithm behind this function is based on packing of the really allocated memory chunks into
* a contiguous memory area, exploiting some threshold-based approach to fasten it up even more.
* The contiguous copy is performed precomputing the size of the full log, and then scanning it
* using a pointer for storing the relevant information.

/**
* This function is the only log function which should be called from the simulation platform. Actually,
* it is a demultiplexer which calls the correct function depending on the current configuration of the
* platform. Note that this function only returns a pointer to a malloc'd area which contains the
* state buffers. This means that this memory area cannot be used as-is, but should be wrapped
* into a state_t structure, which gives information about the simulation state pointer (defined
* via SetState() by the application-level code and the lvt associated with the log.
* This is done implicitly by the LogState() function, which in turn connects the newly taken
* snapshot with the currencly-scheduled LP.
* Therefore, any point of the simulator which wants to take a (real) log, shouldn't call directly this
* function, rather LogState() should be used, after having correctly set current and current_lvt.
