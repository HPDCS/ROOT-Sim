* @brief LP state management
*
* The state module is responsible for managing LPs' simulation states.
* In particular, it allows to take a snapshot, to restore a previous snapshot,
* and to silently re-execute a portion of simulation events to bring
* a LP to a partiuclar LVT value for which no simulation state is available
* in the log chain.
