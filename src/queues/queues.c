/**
* This function generates a mark value that is unique w.r.t. the previous values for each Logical Process.
* It is based on the Cantor Pairing Function, which maps 2 naturals to a single natural.
* The two naturals are the LP gid (which is unique in the system) and a non decreasing number
* which gets incremented (on a per-LP basis) upon each function call.
* It's fast to calculate the mark, it's not fast to invert it. Therefore, inversion is not
* supported at all in the simulator code (but an external utility is provided for debugging purposes,
* which can be found in src/lp_mark_inverse.c)
