 * xxHash - Fast Hash algorithm
 *
 * This functions are used to compute hashes of the payload of events
 * when the `--enable-extra-checks` option is specified. This allows
 * to check whether an event handler has modified the content of an
 * event during processing. This is a serious bug in models which is
 * very hard to spot. Indeed, since events are replayed in optimistic
 * simulation, altering the content of an event will lead to undefined
 * simulation results when an event is executed again due to a rollback,
 * silent execution, or state reconstruction fo CCGS.
